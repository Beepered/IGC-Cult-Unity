The building cursor finally shows the building before you put it down.   
Click on a building to buy and it will show the building when you hover over a tile that is does not already have a building in it.   
It works by having the buildings already spawned and turning them on or off when you choose a building to build.   
This might be annoying later because not all the buildings are made, but that is a later problem.   
Building information is also slightly different.   
Buildings can now be destroyed in events and it is really annoying to look at the code because there is so much repitition for 3 events.
