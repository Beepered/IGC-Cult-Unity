You can put buildings down now.   
It costs money to put a building down but the buildings generate resources every turn.   
Click on a building icon (if you have enough money) and then click on the ground to place the building   
The buildings cannot overlap each other, but you can place stuff outside of the plane (I will try to fix this at some point)   
Otherwise, this is the basic building placement
