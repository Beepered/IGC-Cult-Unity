You can buy, sell, and place buildings down.
Click on a building icon (if you have enough money) and then click on the ground to place the building. Selling a building currently gives 50% of the cost back and removes the variable changes.
The buildings get placed at the cursor using the nearest distance.
You can now cancel out of placing/selling a building when you press on the opposite button. (EX: you are currently placing a building, but want to sell instead, if you press "sell" you are now selling)
You can get information about a bulding when your cursor is over a building or button. It tells you the name, cost, variable changes, and money back when you sell it.
I STILL have to work on the random events.
