You can put buildings down now.   
It costs money to put a building down but the buildings generate resources every turn.
Click on a building icon (if you have enough money) and then click on the ground to place the building
The buildings get placed at the cursor using the nearest distance. They just placed at the grid tile position, so the buildings will have to be centered later. Otherwise, the full building placement works
You still just need 100 insanity to win or 100 suspicion to lose and I still have to work on the random events. Also the current, placeable buildings are really big and uncentered, and there are only 3 buildings
